spk_0,0.0,," key here. Yeah. Okay. Great. Um, yeah. I said, do you want to just get started? I'm gonna be this site coordinator and the patient."
spk_1,11.27,, That's what I understand.
spk_0,12.77,, She
spk_1,13.23,," go. Um, what name will you be using as the patient, please?"
spk_0,19.33,," Um, I have Jane Smith here."
spk_1,21.94,," Okay. Thank you. So, Nicholas firm with you, Your site location, which I understand. Is Dr Weissman"
spk_0,34.85,, yet?
spk_1,36.94,, A being 10.
spk_0,38.19,, You anything good?
spk_1,40.62,," Unusual name. And if I can confirm with you, patient of the A study participants name is we have a female."
spk_0,54.72,, Yep.
spk_1,56.24,, Date of birth is April 1947.
spk_0,59.0,, Yes.
spk_1,60.7,," And my understanding is that the participant is not aware of her a bow e, you know,"
spk_0,67.61,, time that this time that is correct.
spk_1,71.63,," Yeah. If I could have you have available, Uh, is there any no family history of Alzheimer's or familial dementia?"
spk_0,86.14,," Yes, there is. She said they're waas."
spk_1,89.24,, Okay. Thank you. And do you have a study participant? I d digit number?
spk_0,97.53,, Yes. It's 2299001
spk_1,104.63,, And I'm going to confirm that back for you. 2299001 Is that correct? And are you a weird. Wasn't the participant watch the previous video?
spk_0,122.28,, Yes. She said she watched it before. On
spk_1,126.37,, with that today. Or
spk_0,129.44,, has
spk_1,129.62,, it been a little while
spk_0,130.55,," back? Um, she didn't watch it today,"
spk_1,134.34,, so she watched it from trying. Previously. We are not sure How long ago. Okay. Do you have that available that you can hear what
spk_0,146.71,," they Yes, I do. For MMSC 29 GTs zero and M Stye seven."
spk_1,155.64,, Gdf was zero on the guy is
spk_0,161.69,, seven
spk_1,163.06,, seven. No. Yeah. And you share with me Anyone will be attending with doing today?
spk_0,177.77,," No, it's just okay. And you, you"
spk_1,181.9,," know, gain prefers to be called J"
spk_0,183.87,, our This is our
spk_1,185.19,," mister missus or Miss,"
spk_0,188.44,, I think Jane was fine.
spk_1,191.11,," Okay. Thank you. And if you could, um, spring Jane into the room when she's ready and we can begin?"
spk_0,209.3,, Yep. Okay. She's here now on. And I'm going to stop out. Do you need anything else for me?
spk_1,217.44,, I just want to make sure before you
spk_0,219.68,, leave.
spk_1,220.79,, The connection is good. Do you feel that the audio was appropriate? There's nothing that's good and hinderance from being able to hear each other today.
spk_0,231.74,," No, I can hear everything just fine."
spk_1,235.0,," Okay. Great. I came. What I like to do is just give you a little bit of background. As you're aware, you're in the process of participating and the generation study, too. Um and so as a background, I'd like to introduce myself in a little bit about the project. And the University of Pennsylvania is role in the project. Um, before I begin to you have any specific questions?"
spk_0,273.31,," No, no. Right now."
spk_1,275.14,," Okay, great. So my name is Christine. Far Nicolette probably shared with you before she brought in the room. I am a certain genetic counselor and ploy by the University of Pennsylvania. And our role in, uh, particular study is providing the genetic counseling portion of the generation study to as part of the study, every participant before they have a disclosure of there. A PPO e results participate in a genetic counseling session just like the one that we're doing today. There's genetic counselors for the University of Pennsylvania remote accessible across the country. And so our goal is to, uh, keep things. The standardized is possible, which is just our fancy way of saying we, like everybody, receive the same information in somewhat of the same format."
spk_0,338.44,, Sounds good. Yep. Sounds good.
spk_1,343.11,," Okay. Excellent. One of the things that we do for the study is that we do collect various pieces of data, and one of the ways that we collect the data is through a audio recording of today's genetic counseling sessions. This helps us to sure that all the pieces of the study are handled in a similar way As a study participant. I do believe that you signed the form related to this previously. Is that correct?"
spk_0,376.81,," Yes, they did."
spk_1,378.6,, And I wanted to confirm that you are okay with the audio recording of our genetic counseling session today.
spk_0,386.1,, Sure.
spk_1,387.54,," Okay. Now, for a part of the, uh, study, I do need to ask a little bit of demographic. And so, for this portion, portion of the session, I am going to turn the tape recorder off so we try to keep, uh, your information of confidential is possible of. That's why I will only be referring to you. Jane and I will be talking about specifics that would be able to be identified by other people. Do you understand that? Okay."
spk_0,426.56,," Yeah, Sounds good."
spk_1,428.53,," Okay. So or the next portion. I just need to know, Uh, What, your race? Um, yeah. You well, here with me, If I'm not sure you have more questions,"
spk_0,450.48,, Okay? I'm rays Caucasian. And what else did you need to know? Sorry.
spk_1,456.4,," Um, we never been. Need to know if for pork Asian. Are you Hispanic or Latino or not? Hispanic now let you"
spk_0,466.76,, know. Not Hispanic Latino.
spk_1,469.74,," Okay. For Caucasian, you would probably be European."
spk_0,475.86,," Yes, I guess."
spk_1,478.87,," Okay. Excellent. And but one through my little checklist. So you get a few cartoons on my end, That's why."
spk_0,495.29,, No problem.
spk_1,497.01,, And sometimes
spk_0,498.02,, you
spk_1,498.15,," may hear the shuffle a few papers, Because as I go through some of our information, I I will get rid of some of the pieces of paper that I don't need it."
spk_0,509.27,," Okay,"
spk_1,510.98,," Um, so from what I understand from nickel left, the study coordinator he shared with me, you understand that you will have the opportunity to receive you're a pro. E genetic test results today?"
spk_0,529.8,, Yes.
spk_1,531.72,," And, um, have you thought about, uh, getting those results today?"
spk_0,539.13,," Oh, yeah. I want to know them. I think it will be good to know,"
spk_1,544.22,," um, how are you feeling about learning about what your dementia with might be? I"
spk_0,550.24,, feel good. I feel excited. I think having this knowledge will be good for me. Good for me. Family
spk_1,557.32,," one. And can you share with me maybe a little bit about your motivation about participating in the study? Um, why do you want to learn your April even?"
spk_0,570.71,," Yeah, well, my mother had dementia. Um, you know, within the last few years of her life and just being with through through all of that, it was really hard. And, you know, I read that it could be hereditary. Zai started getting nervous about my own risk and, you know, my own Children having to go through that. So I heard about the study, and I thought I'd be interesting to find out."
spk_1,594.0,," That's going. And so, uh, you you watch the video that was related to study. Is that"
spk_0,605.69,," correct? I did, But it was a little while ago, so I don't remember completely."
spk_1,610.82,," Okay, now, one of the questions I'm gonna ask because we're going to review a lot of that information Sometimes if you just being the video yesterday, you might say, Oh, well, I only know, all"
spk_0,624.24,, this is
spk_1,624.9,," the video yesterday. But if it's been a little while, we're going to repeat some of the information from that video. So I wanted you to be aware that I know what know the content of the video, but we want to make sure sure that everybody gets the same information. So for that reason, we will repeat some of the information. And that was helpful for people to"
spk_0,648.49,, hear a thing
spk_1,649.55,," a couple different ways. Uh, when it's due information and information that you want to be able to understand. Well,"
spk_0,658.79,," yeah, that's great. I appreciate that."
spk_1,661.24,," Yeah. So, um, that I want to take with us is you"
spk_0,667.12,, mentioned that your
spk_1,668.07,," mother has the mansion. I'd like to take a little bit of a family history. Reason that we did this is to see what the background is. And it also gives me a little bit of idea. Um, who you're related to, How you're related to them. And so what? We might have people in the family with, um memory loss issues, dementia, cognitive impairment."
spk_0,698.73,, Okay.
spk_1,699.74,," Okay. So, from the intake information in my understanding, is that your 70 year old"
spk_0,708.0,," Yes,"
spk_1,709.44,," you just turned 70. Had a birthday in April, right?"
spk_0,712.94,, Yeah.
spk_1,715.24,," And your mother, uh, you mentioned has dementia a couple of years with her life. Um, how old was she? Is the time of her dad,"
spk_0,726.23,," like, 80."
spk_1,729.84,, And still was the dementia. Something that progressed with time. It did. It started her seventies. Or maybe is the last couple of years where it was really noticeable to you in the family.
spk_0,744.69,, I think it started in her seventies. It was a few years before.
spk_1,750.9,, Would you say mid seventies?
spk_0,753.22,, Yeah. Like around that around mid seventies.
spk_1,756.63,," Okay. And do you have brothers and sisters were gonna jump down t your generation. Now we'll go back up to Mom's in a little bit, but let's jump down to your generation. You have? Probably"
spk_0,772.98,, Yes. I have a brother and a sister.
spk_1,778.48,, Are they both living?
spk_0,779.96,, Yes.
spk_1,781.3,, Okay. Yeah. Can you share with me? Their car
spk_0,784.61,," agent? Uh, yes. My sister is 68 my brother is 74."
spk_1,793.19,," Oh, and then for you. Do you have Children?"
spk_0,799.31,, Yes. I have three Children.
spk_1,806.47,," Oh, boy or girl?"
spk_0,808.02,, Two girls. One boy.
spk_1,810.58,, And who would be the oldest?
spk_0,812.43,, The voice. The oldest. He is 50. Yeah.
spk_1,821.9,," Okay. And then the daughters,"
spk_0,824.69,, 45 43.
spk_1,832.04,," And, um, is there father still living?"
spk_0,835.73,, Yes.
spk_1,838.14,, Are you currently with their father?
spk_0,840.44,, Yes. We're still married.
spk_1,842.38,," Okay, so would you say he's a support system for you? For part of the"
spk_0,851.58,," Yeah, he's been great. And I think he was really supportive of my decision to be in the study. And we've talked a lot about"
spk_1,857.71,, it. And have you shared this with your Children as well? Or are you waiting to be result before you go the next step?
spk_0,866.92,," Talk with Children. I haven't shared any of those with them yet. I don't know yet. If I if I'll tell them. I guess it depends on what the results are. You know, my sense says work. What a lot of"
spk_1,880.08,, people in the study you're looking at like told me what I've got. No. First. And then I'll move on and figure out who needs to know.
spk_0,888.36,," Yeah,"
spk_1,889.64,, very common. I I like to keep a gyn for everyone. So if I could have the age of your husband
spk_0,898.64,," Uh, yeah, he's my age."
spk_1,900.72,," Okay. To, um, your parents' generation again, Your father. Is he still living? Or a CPAP"
spk_0,915.97,, know he's passed away.
spk_1,919.74,, Hold. Was he at the time of his passing?
spk_0,922.7,, 85
spk_1,927.41,, for your father? Was there any are noticeable changes in terms of possible dementia or
spk_0,937.72,," No, not that I can think of."
spk_1,945.24,, What can you share with me about your father's mother and father?
spk_0,952.06,, Money
spk_1,952.4,," or any history of any cognitive in, uh, delays, their parents impairment. Any dementia of just is there?"
spk_0,962.04,," Well, I didn't really know them, so I don't know. I didn't hear any stories about it or anything like that. They both lived into their seventies, as far as I know. So not that I know off."
spk_1,975.18,," Okay, I'll just jot a note that it's known. And how about any of your father's brothers?"
spk_0,982.85,, He's a no.
spk_1,985.04,," Uh, Are there any still living?"
spk_0,989.91,," No. He and how many brothers? Uh, just him."
spk_1,997.34,," So don't get okay. That makes that buddy for your mom. Uh, Did brothers?"
spk_0,1009.29,, Yes. She had the sister.
spk_1,1015.6,, So did the one.
spk_0,1016.76,, Yes. It's just the
spk_1,1017.76,, one. Yeah. Is she living?
spk_0,1021.18,," No, She's passed away,"
spk_1,1023.59,," you know, across the age of or Catholic."
spk_0,1027.09,," She's in her seventies, maybe mid seventies or so."
spk_1,1030.98,, Okay. And are we aware of any dementia
spk_0,1037.57,," thing? No, I don't think she had any."
spk_1,1046.11,," And your mother's parents? Uh, do you know, approximately a corner? They're gonna"
spk_0,1054.82,," I think they were around their eighties. From what I know, no dementia, as far as I'm aware."
spk_1,1070.84,," And is there anyone else in the family that you're aware of? An extended family, perhaps? Cousins on your mom's? There are no cousins on your thighs. It may have dementia or Alzheimer's."
spk_0,1086.5,," No, no, not that I know."
spk_1,1089.08,," Okay, so thanks for flooding me clean that it kind of let's see who's related to human, how they're related and a little bit more about the family. So it it appears that the only known of dementia that we have was your mom and in her mid seventies that no one else?"
spk_0,1111.84,, Yep.
spk_1,1114.14,," And then, as far as other people knowing about your participation in this study, you mentioned that your been it's a wear your Children. Not yet. And I decided about talking with them about this, uh, you did with your sister and your brother"
spk_0,1135.25,," at all. No, I haven't brought it up yet, but I probably Well, I plan Teo."
spk_1,1141.52,," Okay. You know, because they're both of age that they might want to participate in study two."
spk_0,1148.05,, Okay. Yeah.
spk_1,1152.7,," Um, you just take a couple quick note here again."
spk_0,1158.85,, Sure
spk_1,1160.86,, and can. Making sure that I'm okay. Probably want to One thing I forgot to ask. And I certainly hope that it provided for you. I forgot to ask you if they left with you. The visual aid package there that is labeled generation study. Standardized inflammation.
spk_0,1191.26,," Yes, I do have that economy."
spk_1,1193.8,," Okay. Excellent. Always right. I asked at the beginning, but I'm glad you have it. But we don't have to open up the door and get a cold back in here."
spk_0,1205.16,, No problem.
spk_1,1207.36,," One thing I'll share with you Sometimes we're working on a slightly different version. So if I referred to a specific paging and it doesn't sound like what you're being on your page, please dot me and say I don't think my page that"
spk_0,1225.02,, okay sounds good.
spk_1,1227.54,," If it doesn't sound like we're on the same page, let me know when I'll try to figure out what we need to go to subscribe to you well enough that you can get to the"
spk_0,1240.91,, sound.
spk_1,1242.14,, So we're just going through some of the pages. We're not gonna cover every teach it would take up the
spk_0,1248.95,, very way
spk_1,1250.28,," we're going to bend Are the next half hour on, uh, first stages of"
spk_0,1257.25,, the
spk_1,1257.67,, papers. So I want you to be reassured. We're not. You don't send five minutes money pace. We're just going to highlight if using a number of the
spk_0,1266.31,, pages.
spk_1,1267.52,," Um, do you have any questions about about that?"
spk_0,1270.65,," No, not right now."
spk_1,1272.48,," And do you have any specific questions or concerns that you want to talk about before we start going through some of the risk information? Oh, for the study?"
spk_0,1283.18,," No, no, just, you know, excited to find out my result."
spk_1,1287.63,," Okay, so, um, the first page just a little bit of background. Um, we're gonna cover some background information about a hoagie, and we're going to talk about some of the estimated risk, and we're going to bump it up a few terms of along the way. So if you don't have to page number two, we, like, get everybody kind of on a level playing ground here. So when we're looking at a cognitive issues, we're looking at you know what the brain ability so do was memory, thinking and language and problem solving and decision making. And there's a normal aging cross that we go through, and our memory is not as good at it. Yes, it is 30 and 70 as it is at 50."
spk_0,1349.88,, That's
spk_1,1350.27,, a normal leaking
spk_0,1352.49,, where
spk_1,1353.41,, you forget
spk_0,1354.89,, where
spk_1,1355.22,, you like your teens sometime and what we're looking from the study from the difference between mild cognitive impairment. You put that on
spk_0,1372.34,, board. I think I remember it from the video that I can't remember what it means.
spk_1,1376.84,," Yeah, so my apartment hip impairment is what we get. Small changes in memory, but noticeable and measurable, and this particular time causative off evaluation. We can get three possible out sometimes. Ah, mild, carpal, different table. And sometimes it'll be kind of a temporary thing going on, and you might return back to kind of the normal aging publishing, and then sometimes the mild cognitive it will progress. And so the match is what we have, um, of decline in mental ability to severe have to interfere with daily life. You have any questions about the term specifically,"
spk_0,1440.64,," um, it gets What's the like, I don't know, Like the breaking point between when it moves from, like, em. See eye to dementia."
spk_1,1450.7,," Well, again, that would be when whether could change that. That passed a breaking point where it really expect your daily activity. So be inability to find your keys. But finding a someplace else given day may not affect your daily"
spk_0,1469.45,," activity, but"
spk_1,1471.34,," daily activity say, if you're riding in a car, ready for that where you are."
spk_0,1478.65,," Okay,"
spk_1,1480.34,, so it's that difference between little bit of a decline. We now have an activity levels that is really kind of stopping it from being able to do things as independently. And we were able to do things before.
spk_0,1498.16,, Okay.
spk_1,1499.24,, Does that make sounds?
spk_0,1500.3,, Yeah. Yeah. I don't think you
spk_1,1502.8,, and all time all these is the most common cause of dementia. And so that's one of the reasons why we're doing the study is they
spk_0,1512.91,, have
spk_1,1514.64,, help us understand the most common cause
spk_0,1518.07,, of it. Cough as your
spk_1,1523.42,," are aware, one of"
spk_0,1524.54,, two things
spk_1,1526.04,," available today for you to actually get your a post gene results feel church Page three. I wanted to review a little bit of background about the 80 P. Cane, Did you have any background in genetic that any time in your life?"
spk_0,1546.99,," I mean, back in school. But I'm sure things were really different than"
spk_1,1551.94,," well, they are. They have changed"
spk_0,1554.17,, a lot
spk_1,1555.22,," a lot in my little genetic career, but we're going to talk about today is very dated. I'm not going to expect you to be a model,"
spk_0,1565.34,," Okay, we're gonna talk"
spk_1,1567.5,," about very basic. So one of the basic is that for all genes in our body, we have two copies of all James. And that is true also for the aging. So we get one copy from our mom and one copies from our dad. And this is true for all gene, regardless of what the gene is. So the April e gene actually comes in three different types, and you probably were never from the video. That's a free type start to before. And he was the most rare. E three is the most common, and before it fight that we're looking at related to a risk factor for cognitive impairment. The mild cognitive impairment, or dimension."
spk_0,1629.04,, Okay.
spk_1,1631.14,, E two or three did not have no increased risk for mild cognitive impairment or dementia Do the outside.
spk_0,1643.54,, Okay.
spk_1,1645.2,, And in the study were specifically booking for candidates for the study cooled house. One or two copies of the A bogey.
spk_0,1661.0,," Okay,"
spk_1,1661.29,," Four, because those are the risk factors. So what we know is that about"
spk_0,1667.89,, 20% of people have
spk_1,1670.92,," one copy of the four, and so the other copy could be another combination, and then only about 2 to 4% of the population have to copy of me before. And if you could see on the list, because there's three different, uh, height and two copies, one from each parent. We have six different possible combinations off a pokey."
spk_0,1706.53,," Okay,"
spk_1,1708.32,, any questions about the genetics combination
spk_0,1716.1,, Come about that make sense?
spk_1,1718.82,," Okay. What Page four? One of the things that we like to know is about when we have an individual, a po B gene or vote. We are not currently using the die or prescribed specific preventing problems. However, based on your specific able teachings result, you may be able to continue screening for per two of the study"
spk_0,1757.19,, there.
spk_1,1759.14,, So how do you feel about identifying in April? You were so and it only being able to give you a risk factor and not necessarily being able to prescribe or guide with treatment at this point.
spk_0,1778.94,," I mean, it makes me nervous, obviously, because I know and it can't do anything about it. But I think it's better to know than not. No, I mean, yeah, there no guarantees that it would or wouldn't get it. But there's no guarantees in anything anyway, right?"
spk_1,1796.06,, Exactly. So the way the study is better if you
spk_0,1802.7,, have
spk_1,1803.05,," one copy of the A O. P. Four, then you can move on for consideration for the next phase of the study."
spk_0,1812.67,," Okay,"
spk_1,1814.81,," so at that point, you may be eligible for a clinical trial. And have you thought about the idea of being in a clinical trial? How do you feel about that?"
spk_0,1828.99,, I would definitely want to do it.
spk_1,1832.64,," So would you want to do it for the hope that you might gain Some personal came from it were from the test, but it's particular hating in a larger group of data that will allow more information."
spk_0,1850.91,," I think both if it does turn out to be something that's helpful, like, obviously that would be great for me and Of course, I understand that. You know, I might just get the placebo, but, you know, there is a 50% chance that I could get something that might actually work, But just more than that, I think, you know, the sort of research has really agreed, and especially for these kinds of conditions where there's no cure right now. And I think it's really great that people are working on this and I want to help and contribute as much as I can."
spk_1,1882.23,," Excellent. And it helped me that you understand that you could get a placebo. And that's what clinical trials are all about. Yeah, testing a known drug again, not having a drug so excellent. There certainly are clinical trials for everybody gets something. But in this particular trial yet half the people will get something in half of them. Well, yes, people that we can use as a comparison. And if you flip to Cage by"
spk_0,1920.39,," Uh huh,"
spk_1,1921.95,," I'm just the highlight that as we had talked about before, a pokey four is a risk factor. But as we've talked about, it's not going to predict will or will Not Yet, so some people will have no copy of the four and still have mild cognitive, caramel or dementia. Do the Alzheimer's and some people can get one or two copies of before and still not how either the mild cognitive impairment or the dementia and we'll find is that about 1/3 of people that, um, have dementia or mild cognitive impairment have no copy to be four. And there are people who have one or two copies of before and do not get old timers or dementia. So we're hoping through the study to learn more about some of that."
spk_0,1985.86,," Yeah,"
spk_1,1991.41,," And if you'll turn to take stick,"
spk_0,1994.33,, huh?
spk_1,1996.34,," Just the highlight of the already mentioned several times is today is gonna be your opportunity to learn your A both the results. And it does give a some information about your risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia, do the Alzheimer's and also help us for the next step of determining whether you're eligible for participating for the screening for the part two of the generation, any questions about that? And are you still feeling at this point that you it we're probably gonna want to get your results?"
spk_0,2042.69,," Yeah, definitely."
spk_1,2044.35,," Okay, Um doesn't. We're just going to highlight a few things related to, um, overall concept to consider again receiving your hope. The results were also going to look it before federation. So you know, one of the things that when we are getting genetic information, we already talked a little bit about Would you share this with your siblings? Would you share that with your Children? And because it is genetic, sometimes we don't need to kind of think about who we want to share with and what family members were comfortable sharing with it. Sounds like you've given that thought, um, still a little uncertain time about your Children. But maybe considering maybe a little sooner talking with your with your siblings that correct?"
spk_0,2106.86,," Yes,"
spk_1,2110.28,," way. Also talk about results of any nature with genetics is just kind of response that we get sometimes the response, uh, be an emotional response. Uh huh. If we get a result in the low risk, have a hope that, um, we can maybe move forward was a little less concern way get a result that has two coffees, a G or one copy of pokey. That might give us a different emotional response have you thought about what might be a You have no April E or have one or two a bow. So then you're"
spk_0,2167.3,," Yeah, Well, I think if they had to, to the, um, the four ones. I mean, it would make me nervous, but I think it's it's better to know than than not. No, um, I would worry about what that would mean for my Children and, you know, for my siblings and all that. But I'd rather know what's there then. Not don't learn it."
spk_1,2196.39,, It sounds like your information paper type person.
spk_0,2199.41,," Yeah, I think so."
spk_1,2201.93,, Maybe one of the reasons that this study appealed to you.
spk_0,2205.66,," Yeah,"
spk_1,2208.6,," Um, one of the other areas that we look at the thing is"
spk_0,2215.51,," the area of burns, okay,"
spk_1,2219.43,, and genetic or so if you'll look to page nine.
spk_0,2227.13,, Uh huh.
spk_1,2229.28,," That we have of any kind are protected by emotional, called Gina, which is the genetic information nondiscrimination. Or this is a piece of legislation that protects, uh, it protects for health insurance and goin in, uh, against discrimination. So what that is saying is that if we have a certain genetic traditions or genetic test for you, so that we cannot be discriminated against for either in health insurance or employment and one of the categories I always want to point out so that it is not covered life insurance for long care insurance, disability policy, the insurance policies that we might pick up to cover for nothing. Home repair."
spk_0,2293.42,," Okay,"
spk_1,2294.61,, and then it also does not cover health insurance. It's a small workplace with only 15 or less employees. Would any of the coverage be concerning to you
spk_0,2309.46,," now? I don't think so. I'm retired already, and I'm on Medicare, and my husband and I already have life insurance. And so I don't think I'm applying for anything else any time soon."
spk_1,2321.51,," And that's always one of the questions by asking if you're thinking of making any changes in any of those policies urine so could be asked for. So if you're already in place, then it's not something that you think about. Court changing were good, good shape there."
spk_0,2342.92,, I'm card.
spk_1,2347.19,," And now if you'll look back page eight, I know we have you looking"
spk_0,2350.51,, around. She did okay
spk_1,2352.9,," if we were face to face in my room, I"
spk_0,2355.69,," weigh already highlighted, but I just want"
spk_1,2362.26,, to point out again. Yeah. We want to just be sure that you're aware of taking into consideration with family members. And then any possible reactions you might have your results.
spk_0,2378.06,, Okay.
spk_1,2379.23,, Any questions that you have about anything that you read on this page?
spk_0,2384.02,," Um, so if I did come back with, um, with the two the fours Does that mean my Children will have that too?"
spk_1,2396.52,, What we would not know it is whether your Children would get a copy of an E four from your husband from their dad.
spk_0,2406.4,," Okay,"
spk_1,2408.11,, We would know if you had two copies of before Way would know that your Children would get at least one copy.
spk_0,2417.18,," Okay,"
spk_1,2418.31,," If you have two copies of exactly the same gene type, they could only get that gene type."
spk_0,2426.41,," Okay,"
spk_1,2427.81,," but if you have a result in the three e four, they make it the three. They may get four."
spk_0,2439.51,, Okay.
spk_1,2440.91,, We still don't know what their father is giving to them.
spk_0,2446.68,, Okay?
spk_1,2448.32,," And if you like, let me find the page in the book. Sometimes people asked him, and I need to clip to it. There's actually a little worksheet in in a study, guys. So you go back to me each one C four. So with page 24 once we know your specific a pro E results, we can put that yet."
spk_0,2477.68,, Okay.
spk_1,2479.37,," And then you can put in the results for your Children. So if you haven't a PPO e three e four, we would know the half the Children past the time the Children will get an E and half the time they'll get a four."
spk_0,2497.14,," Okay,"
spk_1,2498.7,, that makes them
spk_0,2499.59,," Yeah, yeah, but we still wouldn't know about what? What? My husband gave thumb and he got tested. About"
spk_1,2507.19,, the only way to know for sure for the Children would
spk_0,2511.18,, be
spk_1,2511.43,," for either them to get tested and they would know, or for your husband to get tempted. And then you not still know exactly what what each of your three Children have. But you would know what the possibilities are."
spk_0,2528.84,, Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
spk_1,2531.82,, If you have one
spk_0,2533.52,," copy of it before,"
spk_1,2534.96,, and your husband
spk_0,2536.1,, has one
spk_1,2536.79,," copy of a need for them, it is possible for your Children to get to a copy, but they could get one from each of you."
spk_0,2543.84,, Okay. Okay.
spk_1,2545.06,," But if you have one copy, and he has done. They can only give one"
spk_0,2549.61,, I've had.
spk_1,2550.7,, Or if you have two copies and he has done it can still only get one.
spk_0,2555.32,," Okay, Demming, since"
spk_1,2556.63,, May make them
spk_0,2558.48,, foot
spk_1,2558.86,, question. But they all lot of genetic bird bites Information we like together for our Children.
spk_0,2567.56,," Yeah,"
spk_1,2569.9,, and keeping in mind we have no control over how we distribute are genetic that we get from our parents or give to our Children.
spk_0,2578.34,," Yeah. Yeah, it's a good point."
spk_1,2584.09,, Any specific questions at this point?
spk_0,2588.07,," Um, is it a so e? Is it the same sort of thing for my for my brother and sister? Like, if if I had to be fours and they would Well, I guess No, because we don't know what my parents had. Right."
spk_1,2604.7,," Exactly way. If we do some of your parents reverse some of your brothers sisters results we could resume with Your parents are, But at this point, we don't"
spk_0,2617.31,, know
spk_1,2618.04,," if they're both, but we don't know your parents results. We could presume that, um, if you have one copy of the four that your brothers or sisters could get one copy."
spk_0,2633.59,, Okay.
spk_1,2634.51,," Well, there. Is there a presumption that we could make this done? Your results?"
spk_0,2638.63,," Uh huh. But it could still be completely different from mine. War. Okay,"
spk_1,2646.41,," back. But because even if you have to eat board, maybe your parents has three four if three before."
spk_0,2659.19,, Okay.
spk_1,2660.6,," And in that case, some of your siblings might not yet board."
spk_0,2666.89,, Okay.
spk_1,2669.42,," And there is a worksheet back in the pages that we have. There's a worksheet page for siblings as well. But once we know years, we can again kind of work backwards. And that that would be paid 25."
spk_0,2684.67,, Okay.
spk_1,2685.78,," And they probably provided you with a pen. So if you wanna start, highlight any of pages to go back to layer. Feel free. Uh, Mark marked up. Any of this that you have in front of you is yours."
spk_0,2697.61,, Okay. Thank you.
spk_1,2704.39,," So we talked about the inheritance. We talked a little bit about things to consider. And at this point, um, we would like to just talk a little bit about general information about the numbers that we're gonna quote once we get our results."
spk_0,2723.85,, Hello?
spk_1,2724.49,, If you'll go to page 28 way in the back.
spk_0,2730.99,," Yes,"
spk_1,2732.79,," what? I was going out. The the numbers that I'm going to give you today once we actually reveal your specific a PPO you are. So the numbers that we have are from a very large single study, and you might see a report. Once you get your results, you may off like a lot of people do. A Google search is or, you know, look to the additional information so you may see a report that house off other kinds of numbers. So what? We know that you do different studies. Different studies give us different result. Sometimes our prediction for this specific study we're giving number one very large single study, not combined. Studies way feel provide they for the wrist and accuracy of ranges."
spk_0,2802.88,, Okay.
spk_1,2804.08,," Okay. So way know people look, look in other sources, we just want to make sure that you understand that. Why your numbers that you find maybe a little different than what we give to you."
spk_0,2819.38,, Okay.
spk_1,2820.77,," Okay. Based on everything we've talked about so far, you do want to get your April. You felt that it?"
spk_0,2839.7,," Yes. Yes, Agent."
spk_1,2842.38,, And did you have any other questions or confirm things that you want toe ask for just come Before we actually did reveal your specific results?
spk_0,2853.68,, No.
spk_1,2856.81,," Okay. Uh, so am I hearing that this is a confirmation that you love? Me too. Um, that's your result."
spk_0,2866.43,," Yes, please."
spk_1,2868.04,," Okay. Um, what I will share with you is that I have not looked at your results before today. Way tried to conceal those so that we can, uh, are construction with you non by it."
spk_0,2885.04,, Okay.
spk_1,2886.71,," And so in my fifties were betting because I worked for a moment. I get results from the computer. So I'm going to be opening up a computer file that I have ready for this, Blake."
spk_0,2900.1,, Okay.
spk_1,2901.44,, And I'm gonna confirm first that it is your folks that someone else.
spk_0,2907.38,," Okay,"
spk_1,2909.33,," so give me just a second here. I'm going to open this up. Um, it's"
spk_0,2915.4,, a two
spk_1,2915.77,," page report. Uh, well, two pages file, and so I only open a first page for firms that way. Have you, Jane? And because of the pacing, I'm not gonna your full name. But you were born in April. Was that"
spk_0,2936.0,, correct? Yes.
spk_1,2937.67,, Okay. And then you'll give me a second. Let me scroll to the next page. and we have open. And this shows me that your results uh huh was collected in December. And is that right?
spk_0,2959.15,, Yes.
spk_1,2960.07,, You use the minute after gene match in December and your results showing me that you have to coffee of the A po B for
spk_0,2976.71,, okay.
spk_1,2979.36,," And as we discussed was one or two copies. Then you are eligible to proceed on too screening for the next level. Look, buddy,"
spk_0,2993.18,, okay.
spk_1,2996.13,," What are your thoughts about results? I know I didn't know the result before, but you were asking a lot of questions about 8 44 And so I think we covered a lot of questions. Uh, now that you have Ah, a result that is 44. Are there more questions that you have?"
spk_0,3022.76,," Um, so I know we talked about that. It's just a risk factor. And it's not a guarantee. Um, what? And I know we talked about the numbers a little bit, but can you just go over again? Like what? Exactly the chances are of developing Alzheimer's with this result."
spk_1,3043.13,, Perfect leading. That's where I'm heading.
spk_0,3045.82,," Okay,"
spk_1,3047.76,," so I'm not putting the pages because I didn't know the results. We got them So let me look to the right. So if you will go Teo 20 water couple pages. So this is showing you what your result is 44. You have two copies of the four. And if you flip to the next page, this gives you those ranges that we talked about."
spk_0,3087.23,," Okay, Okay."
spk_1,3089.83,," In the upper bar, what we're looking at is your risk through age 80 by we'll kind of have to have a range between because, we don't know up to 100 but we have data that shows us up to age 85. So you're with E 4 84 So, through age 85 you're which is an estimate of developing mild cognitive impairment. Four dimensions. You want to try 30 55%? Yeah. Sometimes it's nice to kind of flipped. The numbers got out of the bottom. It shows what your risk of not developing these positions. So you're not developing these conditions. It's 45 to 70%."
spk_0,3147.25,," Okay, that looks better."
spk_1,3151.01,, Nice to look at the numbers both ways. That that it's not an absolute
spk_0,3156.97,," number,"
spk_1,3157.2,," just and there is a range. And again, these are the the data that were collected from that large single study, and we feel is an accurate range for someone who has the genetic genotype, which is the genetic results that you had of 44. And what are the other things that we like to talk about? Or some of the other factors that might modify this"
spk_0,3188.18,, kind
spk_1,3188.5,," of into your A PPO e results. There may be other modifiers of this, but we'll turn to page 29. We can look at some of the other risk factors."
spk_0,3202.45,, Uh huh.
spk_1,3204.61,, And so we have the two columns. You have a page?
spk_0,3210.73,," Uh huh. Yes,"
spk_1,3212.36,," yes. On the left side, we have factors that are known to increase the risk. On the right hand side, we have factors that are known to decrease the risk. And as you can see, a factor that increases the risk of a hip three and just being older, regardless of family, um, being a female relatives in the mail, um, education part of that is due to active mind. Um, are you currently involved in activities that, uh, stimulate your mind like crossword puzzles, or do you have a bridge"
spk_0,3258.46,," club? Yeah. Yeah, I do. My puzzles and all of that every day. So I think I'm okay with that."
spk_1,3267.33,," Yeah. So one factor that we know for demand show whether you have other risk factors Are not keeping your mind active keeping your mind active. But what gives you good, good brain help?"
spk_0,3284.16,, Yeah.
spk_1,3285.79,," Other factors that, like creature risks, are good vascular help. So keeping your cardiovascular healthy, You're doing good daily walk speaking, cropper being diabetes and blood pressure under check."
spk_0,3306.93,," Yeah. Yeah, I would say I'm pretty healthy and pretty active, so I think that's good."
spk_1,3312.28,," Yeah. Oh, how do you feel about your result And then looking at some of these modifiers, You think you've got some balance there, right? And again, we can't necessarily combining these modifiers with your specific a result. So are additional modifiers, not modifiers that we can put in, Uh, parallel with your results there. All right. Some of them will balance a little heavier than others."
spk_0,3360.99,," Yeah. Yeah, I think I feel fine about it. Um, obviously, I'd feel better if I didn't have any fours. But I mean, going over these modifiers and knowing that it's not, you know, I won't definitely have it just because of this result. Um, so I feel fine about it. And I'm happy you can, you know, keep moving on with this clinical trial."
spk_1,3383.9,," Well, that's a reaction than the number over of our participant feel is that, you know, they find out for the study and the hope that they can keep on going in the study and information. So you're one of one of those that will be able to go Want to participate?"
spk_0,3405.93,, Yeah. Yeah.
spk_1,3408.63,," So if you could just share with me maybe your total reaction of today's business and, um how you, uh, are thinking about the next step of the study."
spk_0,3423.26,," Um, I mean, I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking for it to hear more about it and how I can continue with, um, contributing and being a part of the study. Like I said, I'm I'm happy. I know my results cause whether we justify not or not, that's still there. So at least now I know about it. Um and I'm I'm glad to know that there are things that can do. Teo, you know, kind of help with that risk a little bit. Things that are my control"
spk_1,3450.69,, and you mentioned that the numbers. You kind of like the sound of the not developing numbers.
spk_0,3457.69,," Yeah, they"
spk_1,3459.2,, found okay.
spk_0,3459.98,," Yeah. Yeah, that sounds great. Up to 70%."
spk_1,3465.81,," And another question Now that you know your test go, um, Have you thought quick? Few moments. But now I know What are your thoughts about sharing this information with your siblings, and and now, possibly sharing or not sharing with your Children?"
spk_0,3487.69,," I think I want to share this with my siblings. I probably asked them if they want to know first, cause I mean, I think my sister definitely. But But I'm not 100% sure. And my brother would want to know, So I'd probably ask him, Um, I I still I'm not sure about my Children. I think I you know, I want to talk about it a little more with my husband. First. He would he Things kind of decide from there. I don't want them worrying about this right now in their life, You know, they're busy with their own kids and all that, and"
spk_1,3517.99,," that is something that we always have. People think about, um, how you want to prevent the option for your siblings in your Children to know some of them may not want to know. And so rather than just say, Hey, I got this he result in, you know,"
spk_0,3542.7,, she
spk_1,3544.9,," better. No, I don't love it. Um, information. And they said, you know, maybe siblings might want to know or might not want to know, just doesn't opportunity to say yes or no about the information every evening."
spk_0,3560.08,," Yeah, but"
spk_1,3561.25,, always a good idea to ask you that.
spk_0,3564.03,," Yeah, it's a complaint."
spk_1,3566.66,," And your Children may not want to know now, but, um, you know, in another 10 years after the study is done and maybe we know a lot more, Uh, your Children are a little bit older. They want to know what that point."
spk_0,3580.63,," Yeah. Yeah, maybe they'll figure out something by then, too."
spk_1,3589.22,," So if you could share with me, what's your understanding of your risk? It's a point where you want to hit."
spk_0,3598.09,," Um, yes. So I have two copies of E four, which puts me at a higher risk for developing Alzheimer's, but not a guarantee that I will get it. Um, yeah. Then I'm hoping to keep moving forward with the clinical trial"
spk_1,3615.46,, Okay. Any other questions or comments you'd like to make today?
spk_0,3620.98,," No, that's it."
spk_1,3623.71,," And and this point, I usually will ask that you have the study coordinator come back in the room. Uh huh. And certainly, if there are more questions, you can always have the study coordinator contact mean, Can they know how to get a hold of me? And we can connect up again if you have additional questions that you need to answer. And then, of course, the study, uh, ordination site is a very good resource for you. So you'll have the study coordinators people available for you as well. And the important thing is you do have resource is so use them along the way and we're here to support you through this"
spk_0,3672.25,, Kind of sounds good.
spk_1,3674.21,," Okay. So if you will have a collect, come back here and I can recap with her."
spk_0,3680.71,," Okay. Hi, Christine. Think a lot. Nikola High."
spk_1,3688.29,, I just gained.
spk_0,3691.06,, Okay.
spk_1,3692.3,, I did share with her for a body results. She didn't want to have those disclosed for today. Then we did identify that she is eligible to go on with the next step of the study. Crossed out she has two copies of the a PPO e Breathe. So
spk_0,3716.51,, Okay.
spk_1,3718.41,," And she is aware that, um, we're available. If you have additional questions about the study and that your study coordination, it is also available."
spk_0,3729.92,, Okay. Sounds good.
spk_1,3732.36,, Is there anything else that you need to know from me? Nicholas?
spk_0,3737.26,," No, that's it. We'll talk to Jane a little bit more about the next steps for"
spk_1,3740.77,," her. Okay. Well, thank you. And thank you, Jane. Is she still in the room?"
spk_0,3748.22,," Yeah,"
spk_1,3750.07,, but you're saying it was a pleasure
spk_0,3751.9,, meeting
spk_1,3752.26,, you by telephone
spk_0,3753.19,," today. You, too."
spk_1,3756.25,, And we will look over your participation in in the study process.
spk_0,3763.87,, Thank
spk_1,3764.17,, you.
spk_0,3765.5,," Okay. Very. Um, yeah. So I'll just stop the recording now. And it was good. Talking to you is kind of fun. She"
spk_1,3775.6,," okay, so I stopped on my butt. You have all of"
spk_0,3780.75,," that? Yeah, I think I'm all of it here."
spk_1,3784.01,," So with my first run through, give me immediately back. Please."
spk_0,3788.77,," E, I don't have I mean fast will be the one toe listen in and give me all your back. Okay? But it was fun on my end. Okay."
spk_1,3804.0,," Uh, hopefully she'll be able to kind of share. It's a whole new area for me."
spk_0,3811.69,," Yeah,"
spk_1,3813.8,, I think it is probably for everybody.
spk_0,3816.26,," Yeah, Yeah,"
spk_1,3818.65,," I I've been telling you along the way for the last couple of years, Like he's getting all these focal, that one of my cancer site. They find out for my"
spk_0,3834.41,," day,"
spk_1,3836.7,, and I always refer them someplace else.
spk_0,3840.77,, That's buddy.
spk_1,3842.49,," So now I have to stop referring on someplace else, but I can get my main referral. Could be. Well, if you're over a certain age, we'll go to the study."
